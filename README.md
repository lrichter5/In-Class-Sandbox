# In-Class-Sandbox

Here , Iam learning about using git as my version control system.

The `README.md` file is a markdown file where I can share important notes about my code repository.

I can create **bold** text (wrapped by 2 asterisks) or *italc* text (wrapped by one asterick).

I can create fenced code blocks using back-ticks (`), like this

```csharp
public static viod Main(string[] args)
{
 Console.Writeline("Hello World");
}
'''

I am learning about:

- Creating a grit repository (online, and on my computer)
- Synchronizing my git repository on [GitHub](https://github.com)
